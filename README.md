# 201-assign1
Check out the project spec [here](http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs201/assign1.html)
The second project for my Spring 2018 CS class, Data Structures and Algorithms. It contains classes and headers for a binary search tree and a heap.

### Header/Class Files I wrote are:
  - integer.h/integer.c
  - sll.c/sll.h
  - dll.c/dll.h
  - stack.c/stack.h
  - queue.c/queue.h
  - bst.h/bst.c
  - heap.h/heap.c
  - heapsort
  
These classes work with any generic data type. The INTEGER/REAL/STRING classes are used to test integer, real, and string values.
Files such as bst-0-0.c are test files.

### Instructions:

To build all: make

To build individually: 
  - make test-sll
  - make test-dll
  - make test-stack
  - make test-queue
  
To test:
  1. make
  2. make test
  
To clean: make clean
